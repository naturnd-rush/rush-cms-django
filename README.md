# What's The RUSH?
Visit [What's the RUSH](https://whatstherush.ca).

The Resilient Urban Systems and Habitat, or RUSH, Initiative is a collective mapping effort that leverages both community knowledge and government data to idenfity, track, and share climate change data, community resources, and implemented solutions.

We would like to officially recognize that the RUSH Initiative is exploring this work on the unceded and unsurrendered territories of the lək̓ʷəŋən and SENĆOŦEN speaking peoples. Maps have a long history of erasure of Indigenous cultures and territories. Our goal is to promote tools that support the healing of ecosystems and communities so that all beings can live their best life.


If you have any questions or want to to contribute to the RUSH Initiative, either as a developer or in some other capacity, feel free to reach out to our team lead _Anne-Marie Daniel_ -- annemarie@naturnd.com, or one of our developers _Doug Johnson_ -- Doug@naturnd.com, _Sam Morris_ -- dodobird181@gmail.com.
